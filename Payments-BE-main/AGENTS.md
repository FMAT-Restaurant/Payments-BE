# Payments Service - Agent Instructions

## Project

`Payments-BE` is a .NET 10 microservice responsible for payment and billing processing (cobros y pagos) in the restaurant system.

It serves as the backend intermediary API for the Frontend application repository.

## Architecture: MVC sin Vista (Model-Controller Backend)

The project follows an **MVC pattern without View**:

|  Frontend Repository  |  <--- The "View" (External Client)

```

### 1. Controllers / Endpoints (The "C")

The Controller/Endpoint layer is responsible for HTTP communication with the frontend:

- Exposing RESTful HTTP endpoints.
- Parsing and validating HTTP request bodies and query parameters.
- Returning appropriate HTTP status codes (`200 OK`, `201 Created`, `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`).
- Exposing OpenAPI / Swagger metadata.

**Rules:**
- Controllers must remain thin.
- Do not place domain rules, transaction calculations, or direct external gateway logic inside Controllers.
- Delegate all business operations to the Services layer.

### 2. Services Layer

The Services layer contains the core business logic of the microservice:

- Orchestrating payment operations (authorization, capture, refunds, cancellations).
- Managing transaction statuses and payment lifecycle rules.
- Integrating with external payment gateways or third-party providers.
- Emitting events or notifications when transactions complete.

**Rules:**
- Keep Services decoupled from HTTP transport specifics (`HttpContext`, `HttpRequest`).
- Ensure operations are idempotent where applicable.

### 3. Models and DTOs (The "M")

The Model layer represents data structures and domain representations:

- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Define clean, stable contracts for input and output with the Frontend.
- **Entities / Domain Models:** Represent the state of payments, invoices, accounts, and transactions.
- **Data Access:** Repositories or DbContext for persistence operations.

**Rules:**
- Do not expose internal persistence entities directly to the API if a DTO is required to maintain a decoupled contract.
- Keep Models focused on data representation and invariants.

---

## General Rules

- **Code Formatting:** All code contributions must adhere to repository standards and pass `dotnet format --verify-no-changes`.
- **Commit Messages:** Must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`).
- **Scope Discipline:** Do not perform unrelated refactoring or edit files outside the requested scope.
- **Frontend Compatibility:** Maintain backward compatibility for API contracts consumed by the Frontend repository unless breaking changes are explicitly requested.

## Workflow Protocol

Agents collaborating on this repository follow a structured 3-phase lifecycle tracked in `.agents/current/`:

### 1. Analysis & Planning Phase (`analyst`)
- Save the incoming task description to `.agents/current/request.md`.
- Inspect existing Controllers, Services, Models, and routes.
- Formulate the minimal implementation plan in `.agents/current/plan.md`.
- Generate explicit, file-specific task instructions in `.agents/current/editor-task.md`.
- **Do not modify application source code during this phase.**

### 2. Execution Phase (`editor`)
- Implement strictly the approved scope defined in `.agents/current/editor-task.md`.
- Touch only the files explicitly designated as writable targets.
- Adhere strictly to the MVC without View separation.
- Document changes in `.agents/current/execution-report.md`.

### 3. Audit & Verification Phase (`auditor`)
- Verify architectural compliance (Controllers -> Services -> Models/Persistence).
- Execute verification commands:
  ```powershell
  dotnet format --verify-no-changes
  dotnet build --configuration Release
  dotnet test --configuration Release
  ```
- Document validation status and findings in `.agents/current/auditor-report.md`.
