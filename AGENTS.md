# Payments Service - Agent Instructions

## Project

`Payments-BE` is a .NET 10 microservice responsible for payment and billing processing (cobros y pagos) in the restaurant system.

It serves as the backend intermediary API for the Frontend application repository.

## Architecture: MVC sin Vista (Model-Controller Backend)

The project follows an **MVC pattern without View**:

```

### 1. Controllers / Endpoints (The "C")

The Controller/Endpoint layer is responsible for HTTP communication with the frontend:

- Exposing RESTful HTTP endpoints.
- Parsing and validating HTTP request bodies and query parameters.
- Returning appropriate HTTP status codes (`200 OK`, `201 Created`, `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`).
- Exposing OpenAPI / Swagger metadata.

**Rules:**
- Controllers must remain thin.
- Do not place domain rules, transaction calculations, or direct external gateway logic inside Controllers.
- Delegate all business operations to the Services layer.

### 2. Services Layer

The Services layer contains the core business logic of the microservice:

- Orchestrating payment operations (authorization, capture, refunds, cancellations).
- Managing transaction statuses and payment lifecycle rules.
- Integrating with external payment gateways or third-party providers.
- Emitting events or notifications when transactions complete.

**Rules:**
- Keep Services decoupled from HTTP transport specifics (`HttpContext`, `HttpRequest`).
- Ensure operations are idempotent where applicable.

### 3. Models and DTOs (The "M")

The Model layer represents data structures and domain representations:

- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Define clean, stable contracts for input and output with the Frontend.
- **Entities / Domain Models:** Represent the state of payments, invoices, accounts, and transactions.
- **Data Access:** Repositories or DbContext for persistence operations.

**Rules:**
- Do not expose internal persistence entities directly to the API if a DTO is required to maintain a decoupled contract.
- Keep Models focused on data representation and invariants.

## Messaging Decisions (PMC-5)

Agreed in PR #2 review. Do not change without team agreement:

- **Broker:** RabbitMQ (same broker Órdenes publishes to). Connection from `ConnectionStrings:RabbitMq`; the app fails at startup if missing, on purpose.
- **Message contract:** `DinningSessionReadyEvent` uses a fixed `[MessageUrn("DinningSessionReadyEvent")]`; Órdenes must publish with the same URN. Keep the `Dinning` spelling as-is. Shared contracts package vs. fixed URN is pending a meeting with the team representatives; keep the fixed URN meanwhile.
- **Storage:** pending bills live in Redis (`IDistributedCache`, keys `payments:bill:{dinningSessionId}` and `payments:event:{eventId}`) with a 24 h TTL. No SQL table for now.
- **Idempotency:** simple check-then-set by `eventId` in Redis. No `SET NX` or MassTransit Outbox/Inbox; concurrent duplicates write the same data, which is harmless.
- **Ordering:** an event whose `Timestamp` is older than the saved snapshot is discarded.
- **Validation:** done inside the consumer. Move to a generic `UseConsumeFilter(typeof(ValidationFilter<>))` only when there is more than one consumer.
- **DLQ:** failed messages go to the `<endpoint>_error` queue. Monitoring/reprocessing owner is still undefined (to be agreed with whoever owns the event queue).
- **MassTransit license:** pinned to 8.5.x (Apache 2.0); do not upgrade to v9 (commercial). Planned migration target: `RabbitMQ.Client` directly.

## Payment Decisions (PMC-6)

Agreed while implementing PMC-6. Several items are pending confirmation with the story owners (see the PMC-6 PR):

- **Database:** SQL Server via EF Core (`ConnectionStrings:SqlServer`), as referenced by PMC-13/PMC-16. Money is `decimal(18,2)`; enums are stored as text; keys are EF sequential GUIDs. Migrations live in `PaymentsModule/Data/Migrations`.
- **Local infrastructure:** `docker compose up -d` (project name `payments`). SQL Server is published on port **14330** to avoid a native SQL Server install and other local stacks (e.g. Booking-service).
- **Source of truth for the amount due:** the pending bill saved by PMC-5 in Redis. `detalles_snapshot` in the request is validated but not trusted; the persisted items come from the bill. Amount due = `ExpectedTotal + propina`; `Total` = sum of `PaymentBreakdown`.
- **Change:** payments are capped to the amount owed (electronic first, cash absorbs the excess), so change is never stored as income. Electronic payments exceeding the total are rejected (422).
- **Idempotency:** unique index on `DinningSessionId` plus a prior check; both paths return 409.
- **Event:** `PaymentCompletedEvent` with fixed `[MessageUrn("PaymentCompletedEvent")]`, published through the MassTransit EF **bus outbox** (only delivered after COMMIT). This outbox applies to publishes from services; the PMC-5 consumer keeps its Redis idempotency.
- **Folio:** `TX-{yyyyMMdd}-{number:D6}` from the global sequence `transaction_number_seq` (UTC date, does not restart daily).
- **Identity:** JWT Bearer configured in `Authentication:Schemes:Bearer`; the cashier is the `NameIdentifier` (`sub`) claim, never the payload.
- **Cash shift:** `CashShift` has the shape required by PMC-8 (open/close endpoints belong to PMC-8). Charging requires an `Open` shift of the cashier (422 otherwise).
- **Tests:** `ChargeServiceTests` run against a real SQL Server (`payments_tests` database; override with `ConnectionStrings__SqlServer`). CI uses a SQL Server service container.

## General Rules

- **Code Formatting:** All code contributions must adhere to repository standards and pass `dotnet format --verify-no-changes`.
- **Code Language:** All code is written in English: identifiers, types, methods, variables, test names, log messages, comments, and cache keys. No Spanish and no Spanglish. When a wire contract with another service uses Spanish field names, keep the English property and map the name with `[JsonPropertyName]`.
- **Commit Messages:** Must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`).
- **Scope Discipline:** Do not perform unrelated refactoring or edit files outside the requested scope.
- **Frontend Compatibility:** Maintain backward compatibility for API contracts consumed by the Frontend repository unless breaking changes are explicitly requested.

## Workflow Protocol

Agents collaborating on this repository follow a structured 3-phase lifecycle tracked in `.agents/current/`:

### 1. Analysis & Planning Phase (`analyst`)
- Save the incoming task description to `.agents/current/request.md`.
- Inspect existing Controllers, Services, Models, and routes.
- Formulate the minimal implementation plan in `.agents/current/plan.md`.
- Generate explicit, file-specific task instructions in `.agents/current/editor-task.md`.
- **Do not modify application source code during this phase.**

### 2. Execution Phase (`editor`)
- Implement strictly the approved scope defined in `.agents/current/editor-task.md`.
- Touch only the files explicitly designated as writable targets.
- Adhere strictly to the MVC without View separation.
- Document changes in `.agents/current/execution-report.md`.

### 3. Audit & Verification Phase (`auditor`)
- Verify architectural compliance (Controllers -> Services -> Models/Persistence).
- Execute verification commands:
  ```powershell
  dotnet format --verify-no-changes
  dotnet build --configuration Release
  dotnet test --configuration Release
  ```
- Document validation status and findings in `.agents/current/auditor-report.md`.
